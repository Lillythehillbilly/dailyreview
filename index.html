       <h2 id"#aboutme">About Me</h2>
         <p>
             I was born on October 4, 1999 in Orange County. My hobbies include singing, dancing, cheering and acting. I love to put on a show and I am over the top all the time. 
             I have 2 half sibling Marylyn (19) and Wyatt (6). We have the same mom, but different dads. Then I have my full brother Stone who is 17. 
             I love him and Marylyn to the moon and back, but I have only seen Wyatt once in my life and that was when he was born.

             When I am older I want to travel, see the world and experience different cultures. I want to spend a month in Italy more than anything though. Eat the amazing food, meet new people and have the time of my life!
             This world is so big and simply cannot be explored in one life time, so maybe in another lifetime I’ll see everything.

              I recently got my own guinea pigs named Scarface. He is so cute and furry and ugh I can’t get enough of him!!!!!
              He sits on my chest and whenever I pet him he squeaks. He the cutest thing you’ll ever see I promise. 
              I have wanted a guinea pig since I was little. I went to so many different website to get all the information I would need to raise scar the right way.
              I am super excited to see scar grow up a strong and happy little guinea pig.
